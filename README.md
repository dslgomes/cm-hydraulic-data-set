### Data Set Information:

The data set was experimentally obtained with a hydraulic test rig. This test rig consists of a primary working and a secondary cooling-filtration circuit which are connected via the oil tank [1], [2]. The system cyclically repeats constant load cycles (duration 60 seconds) and measures process values such as pressures, volume flows and temperatures while the condition of four hydraulic components (cooler, valve, pump and accumulator) is quantitatively varied.

### Attribute Information:

The data set contains raw process sensor data (i.e. without feature extraction) which are structured as matrices (tab-delimited) with the rows representing the cycles and the columns the data points within a cycle. The sensors involved are:

Sensor / Physical quantity / Unit / Sampling / Rate:

- PS1 / Pressure / bar / 100 Hz
- PS2 / Pressure / bar / 100 Hz
- PS3 / Pressure / bar / 100 Hz
- PS4 / Pressure / bar / 100 Hz
- PS5 / Pressure / bar 100 Hz
- PS6 / Pressure / bar 100 Hz
- EPS1 / Motor power / W 100 Hz
- FS1 / Volume flow / l/min 10 Hz
- FS2 / Volume flow / l/min 10 Hz
- TS1 / Temperature / 째C 1 Hz
- TS2 / Temperature / 째C 1 Hz
- TS3 / Temperature / 째C 1 Hz
- TS4 / Temperature / 째C 1 Hz
- VS1 / Vibration / mm/s 1 Hz
- CE / Cooling efficiency / % / 1 Hz
- CP / Cooling power / kW / 1 Hz
- SE / Efficiency factor / % / 1 Hz

The target condition values are cycle-wise annotated in 'profile.txt' (tab-delimited). As before, the row number represents the cycle number. The columns are

#### 1: Cooler condition:
- 3 -- close to total failure
- 20 -- reduced effifiency
- 100 -- full efficiency

2: Valve condition / %:
100: optimal switching behavior
90: small lag
80: severe lag
73: close to total failure

3: Internal pump leakage:
0: no leakage
1: weak leakage
2: severe leakage

4: Hydraulic accumulator / bar:
130: optimal pressure
115: slightly reduced pressure
100: severely reduced pressure
90: close to total failure

5: stable flag:
0: conditions were stable
1: static conditions might not have been reached yet
